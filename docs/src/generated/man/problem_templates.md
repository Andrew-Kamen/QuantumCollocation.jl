# Problem Templates

We provide a number of problem templates for making it simple and easy to set up and solve certain types of quantum optimal control problems. These templates all construct a `QuantumControlProblem` object.  The problem templates are:
- [`UnitarySmoothPulseProblem`](#Unitary-Smooth-Pulse-Problem)
- [`UnitaryMinimumTimeProblem`](#Unitary-Minimum-Time-Problem)
